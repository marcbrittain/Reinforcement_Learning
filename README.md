# Reinforcement Learning

Project from AeroE 504: Decision Making under Uncertainty. Course taught by Professor Peng Wei.
There are 3 different datasets we were given to work with:
 *  Small.csv - Gridworld environment
 *  Medium.csv - MountainCar Continuous environment
 *  Large.csv - Unknown environment 
 
 For the different envrionments, I implement 2 different reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the problems.
 * Small.csv was solved using maximum likelihood estimation combined with value iteration. It converges to the optimal policy.
 * Medium.csv and Large.csv was solved using a temporal difference Q-learning and creating episodes to split the data. It converged to a policy that performed very well in the MountainCar Environment.
